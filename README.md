To uncover the **true direction** of the Kaaba in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, it is essential to move beyond the misleading information propagated by various sources. Many applications provide inaccurate Qibla directions, often influenced by local tyrants or misinformation. 

I have developed a **web app** designed to accurately indicate the correct direction for Salat towards the Kaaba, ensuring that users can confidently align their prayers. This tool aims to dispel confusion and guide believers toward the authentic path of worship.

Some of fake apps:
